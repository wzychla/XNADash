## Overview

Years ago, in 2011, I've ported an old DOS game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartlight_(video_game)">Heartlight</a>, to XNA. 

The original is playable using a DOS emulator, can be an online one like the one from ClassicReload. 
<a href='https://classicreload.com/heartlight.html'>Click here to play the original version</a>.

In 2025, the old code is recompiled in .NET8/Monogame and published here on Github.

## Assets

* the code was written in C#, completely from scratch, in 2011
* all images are hand-drawn by myself 
* all songs were written by myself back in 2011, using <a href='https://openmpt.org/'>OpenMPT</a>

## Status

There are 70 levels in total. The `LEVELS.HL` file comes from the original. It's a text file that contain all levels. Creating new levels is easy, just edit the text file.

Some levels are playable. Some are not because of invalid timing or subtle differences of in-game physics between the original and the ported version.

I might be able to fix this someday. Or not. Feel free to clone or submit pull requests.

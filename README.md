## Overview

Years ago, in 2011, I've started porting an old DOS game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartlight_(video_game)">Heartlight</a>, to XNA.

The code is written in C#, completely from scratch. All assets are hand-drawn.

Only the `LEVELS.HL` file comes from the original. It's a text file that contain all 70 game levels.

The old code is recompiled in .NET8/Monogame.

## Status

There are 70 levels in total.

Some levels are playable. Some are not because of invalid timing or subtle differences of in-game physics between the original and the ported version.

I might be able to fix this someday. Or not. Feel free to clone or submit pull requests.

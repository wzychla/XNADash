# XNADash

## Overview

Years ago, in 2011, I've ported an old DOS game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartlight_(video_game)">Heartlight</a>, to XNA. The code was written in C#, completely from scratch. All assets are hand-drawn.

In 2025, the old code is recompiled in .NET8/Monogame and published here on Github.

## Status

There are 70 levels in total. The `LEVELS.HL` file comes from the original. It's a text file that contain all levels. Creating new levels is easy, just edit the text file.

Some levels are playable. Some are not because of invalid timing or subtle differences of in-game physics between the original and the ported version.

I might be able to fix this someday. Or not. Feel free to clone or submit pull requests.
